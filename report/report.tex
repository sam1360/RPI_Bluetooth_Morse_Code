\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}


This project's goal was to develop a system to send messages to a Raspberry Pi~3 (RPi3) over Bluetooth and translate them to Morse~code.
The translated message is then transmitted over the RPi3's~GPIO pins to produce a Morse~code message conforming to international Morse~code standards.
In order to accomplish this, two separate programs were created: one program to send the message (capable of being compiled and run on any device with BlueZ installed), and the other to receive the message on the RPi3.
Functions used for each discrete step were developed in separate files for reusability.
A program was also created to test the functionality of each step.
In the end, the system was fully-functional, able to deliver messages through Bluetooth and translate them into GPIO signals.
